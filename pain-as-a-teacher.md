# pain as a teacher

since i was a child, i believe that pain is the best teacher in order to become a better person in life. 

as i grew wiser, i learned that the way i tried to share my beliefs with other people, was not a pleasant experience.

i was, and still am, misunderstood.

i share my personal and painful experiences because i see it as a positive story.

i learned so much out it because i got out of those tough experiences.

most people do not get that. 

some described me as a negative person and a negative influence. 

some say that i am not mentally stable.

i continued to seclude myself further away from familiar society.

i became very selective on who i hangout with.

then one day, i stumbled upon a video by ray dalio.

his narrative on "pain as a teacher" is way much better than mine. 

thank you mister dalio.

now i know that i am not crazy and alone to think that way.
