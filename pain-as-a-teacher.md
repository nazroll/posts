# Pain as a teacher

Since I was a child, I believe that pain is the best teacher in order to become a better person in life. 

As I grew wiser, I learned that the way I tried to share my beliefs with other people, was not a pleasant experience.

I was, and still am, misunderstood.

I share my personal and painful experiences because I see it as a positive story.

I learned so much out it because I got out of those tough experiences.

Most people do not get that. 

Some described me as a negative person and a negative influence. 

Some say that I am not mentally stable.

I continued to seclude myself further away from familiar society.

I became very selective on who I hangout with.

Then one day, I stumbled upon a video by ray dalio.

His narrative on "pain as a teacher" is way much better than mine. 

Thank you mister dalio.

Now I know that I am not crazy and alone to think that way.
