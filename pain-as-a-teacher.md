# pain as a teacher

since i was a child, i developed and still developing, a strong belief that pain is the best teacher in order to be a better person in life. 

as i grew wiser, i learned the way i tried to share my beliefs with other people, was not a pleasant educational experience.

i am misunderstood.

i share my personal and painful experiences because i see it as a positive story.

most people do not get it. 

some described me as a negative person and negative influence. 

some say that i am a mentally not healthy.

i continued to seclude myself further and further away from society.

then one day, i stumbled upon a video by ray dalio.

his narrative on "pain as a teacher" is way much better than mine. 

thank you mister dalio.

i now know i am not crazy and alone to think that way.
