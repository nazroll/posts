# pain as a teacher

since i was a child, i developed and still developing, a strong belief that pain is the best teacher in order to be a better person in life. 

as i grew wiser, i learned that the way i tried to share my beliefs with other people, was not pleasant.

i was, and still am, misunderstood.

i share my personal and painful experiences because i see it as a positive story.

i learned so much out it because i got out of it.

most people do not get that. 

some described me as a negative person and a negative influence. 

some say that i am a mentally not stable.

i continued to seclude myself further and further away from society.

i became very selective on who i hangout with.

then one day, i stumbled upon a video by ray dalio.

his narrative on "pain as a teacher" is way much better than mine. 

thank you mister dalio.

i now know i am not crazy and alone to think that way.
