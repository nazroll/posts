# oh shit! look mom, my face is in be-mag.com

[be-mag.com](https://be-mag.com) is one of my inspirations to start up our rollerblading news website, kjrollers.com, in the late 90s. 

to have my face as one of the photo features in [their article](https://www.be-mag.com/article/faces-of-winterclash-day-ii/) is a huge honor to me.

the article is about how the community, young and old, will persevere and maintain the spirit of rollerblading.

my appreciation goes out to [jonathan labez](https://instagram.com/jmlabez), the photo editor of be-mag.com, for these amazing photos. 

my wife said i look handsome in these photos. 

very apt indeed.

thank you.
